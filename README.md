# weakly-labeled-data-augmentation-to-improve-COVID-19-detection-in-CXRs
The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic resulting in over 2.5 million infected individuals and over a 177,000 deaths at the time of this writing. Respiratory disorders in COVID-19 caused by the virus commonly present as viral pneumonia-like opacities in chest X-ray images (CXR) which is used as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for confirmation, and is also used for evaluating disease progression. However, there is a dearth of good training data toward developing automated decision support tools to alleviate radiological burden. 

While it is desirable to have perfect training data for a problem, we address the problem by expanding training data distribution through the use of weakly-labeled CXR images pooled from publicly available CXRs showing pneumonia-related opacities in a stage-wise manner and train a custom convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm for detecting COVID-19 infections in CXRs. We augment the training data to expand the feature space i) to make the training distribution encompass the variability in the test distribution to enhance the inter-class discrimination and reduce intra-class similarity, and ii) to enhance the diversity of the training distribution to decrease the generalization error by training with samples with a diversified distribution. 

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the performance with weakly augmented training is superior (Acc: 0.637 and Acc: 0.7877) compared to that with the baseline non-augmented training (Acc: 0.2885 and Acc: 0.5028) toward detecting CXRs as showing COVID-19 like viral pneumonia in the publicly available COVID-19 CXR collections, respectively.
